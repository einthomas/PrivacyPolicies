I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (the highscore) created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.
